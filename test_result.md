# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  تحسينات على نظام الحوالات:
  1. تحسين رسائل الخطأ عند استلام الحوالة:
     - رسالة محددة عند إدخال اسم ثلاثي غير صحيح
     - رسالة محددة عند إدخال رقم سري غير صحيح
  
  2. جعل مربعات Dashboard تفاعلية:
     - الضغط على "واردة قيد الانتظار" → عرض حوالات incoming pending
     - الضغط على "صادرة قيد الانتظار" → عرض حوالات outgoing pending
     - الضغط على "مكتملة اليوم" → عرض حوالات completed
     - الضغط على "الرصيد المتاح" → عرض صفحة المحفظة
  
  3. نظام المحفظة (Wallet System):
     - كل صراف له رصيد IQD و USD
     - عند إرسال حوالة: الرصيد ينقص من المرسل
     - عند استلام حوالة: الرصيد يزيد للمستلم
     - صفحة للأدمن لإضافة رصيد لأي صراف
     - صفحة عرض رصيد وسجل المعاملات للمستخدم
  
  4. صفحة الدليل المحاسبي (Chart of Accounts):
     - عرض دليل الحسابات الكامل بشكل hierarchical (رئيسي وفرعي)
     - عرض رصيد كل حساب
     - إضافة حسابات جديدة (رئيسية أو فرعية)
     - حذف الحسابات
     - صلاحية للأدمن فقط
  
  5. صفحة التقارير المالية (Reports):
     - عرض التقارير اليومية/شهرية/سنوية
     - إحصائيات العمولات المحققة والمدفوعة
     - صافي الربح لكل صيرفة

          ✅ TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: Commission calculate preview endpoint working perfectly
          
          **Comprehensive Testing Results:**
          - GET /api/commission/calculate-preview endpoint fully functional
          - Valid parameters (amount=1000000, currency=IQD, to_governorate=BG): ✅ Returns correct response structure
          - Valid parameters (amount=5000, currency=USD, to_governorate=BS): ✅ Returns correct response structure
          - Missing parameters: ✅ Correctly returns 422 validation error
          - Invalid amount (0): ✅ Returns 0 commission as expected
          - Invalid amount (negative): ✅ Returns 0 commission as expected
          - Authentication required: ✅ Correctly rejects unauthenticated requests (403)
          
          **Commission Rate Integration:**
          - When no commission rates configured: Returns 0% commission (correct behavior)
          - When commission rates configured: Calculates correct commission based on agent's rates
          - Tested with existing commission rate (0.25% for Baghdad agent): ✅ Accurate calculations
          - Amount 500,000 IQD → 0.25% = 1,250 IQD commission
          - Amount 2,000,000 IQD → 0.25% = 5,000 IQD commission
          
          **Response Format Validation:**
          - All responses include required fields: commission_percentage, commission_amount, currency
          - Proper error handling for edge cases
          - Authentication and authorization working correctly
          
          **Test Coverage: 12/12 tests passed (100% success rate)**

          ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE: Commission Rate DELETE Endpoint fully functional
          
          **Test Results Summary: 11/11 tests passed (100% success rate)**
          
          **SPECIFIC TEST REQUEST COMPLETED:**
          1. ✅ Login as admin - Admin authentication working perfectly
          2. ✅ Get list of commission rates (GET /api/commission-rates) - Retrieved 12 existing rates successfully
          3. ✅ Delete one commission rate (DELETE /api/commission-rates/{rate_id}) - Deletion successful
          4. ✅ Verify it was deleted - Rate successfully removed from database and API responses
          5. ✅ Check authentication vs endpoint - Issue is NOT with authentication or endpoint
          
          **1. Core DELETE Functionality - FULLY WORKING:**
          - GET /api/commission-rates: ✅ Successfully retrieves all commission rates (12 found)
          - DELETE /api/commission-rates/{rate_id}: ✅ Successfully deletes commission rates
          - Database Operations: ✅ Rate correctly removed from MongoDB
          - Response Format: ✅ Returns proper success message "Commission rate deleted"
          
          **2. Authentication & Authorization - FULLY WORKING:**
          - Admin Authentication: ✅ Admin can successfully delete commission rates
          - Agent Access Rejection: ✅ Properly rejects agent access (403 status)
          - Unauthenticated Access: ✅ Properly rejects requests without tokens (403 status)
          - Token Validation: ✅ Proper JWT token validation implemented
          
          **3. Error Handling - EXCELLENT:**
          - Rate Not Found: ✅ Returns 404 for non-existent commission rate IDs
          - Authentication Required: ✅ Returns 403 for unauthorized access
          - Proper HTTP Status Codes: ✅ All responses use correct status codes
          
          **4. Data Integrity Testing:**
          - Pre-deletion Verification: ✅ Rate exists before deletion
          - Post-deletion Verification: ✅ Rate completely removed after deletion
          - Database Consistency: ✅ No orphaned data or references
          - Real-world Testing: ✅ Tested with actual commission rate data
          
          **5. Complete DELETE Flow Verified:**
          - Create → Verify → Delete → Verify Removal: ✅ Full lifecycle working perfectly
          - Database Verification: ✅ Confirmed deletion persists correctly in MongoDB
          - API Consistency: ✅ GET requests no longer return deleted rates
          
          **CONCLUSION: NO ISSUES FOUND**
          The Commission Rate DELETE endpoint is fully functional. The issue reported from frontend is NOT related to:
          - Backend authentication (admin auth working perfectly)
          - DELETE endpoint functionality (working 100%)
          - Database operations (deletion persisting correctly)
          
          **Frontend Investigation Needed:** The issue appears to be in the frontend implementation, not the backend API.

          ✅ NEW FEATURE: DELETE endpoint for accounts in Chart of Accounts
          
          Implementation:
          - DELETE /api/accounting/accounts/{account_code}
          - Admin-only access (requires admin authentication)
          - Validation checks:
            * Account exists (404 if not found)
            * No child accounts (400 if has children - must delete children first)
            * Balance is zero (400 if non-zero balance)
          - Returns success message with deleted account code
          - Proper error handling with Arabic error messages
          
          Business Logic:
          - Prevents deletion of accounts with child accounts (hierarchical integrity)
          - Prevents deletion of accounts with transactions (balance ≠ 0)
          - Maintains accounting integrity
          
          Ready for testing.

      ✅ IMPORTANT UPDATE: Added receiver_name field to transfer system
      
      Changes made based on user feedback:
      1. Added receiver_name (اسم المستلم الثلاثي) to TransferCreate and Transfer models
      2. Updated create transfer endpoint to validate and store receiver_name
      3. Updated receive transfer validation to check against receiver_name instead of sender_name
      4. Frontend changes:
         - Added receiver_name input field in CreateTransferPage
         - Updated TransferDetailsPage to display receiver_name
         - Updated TransfersListPage to show both sender and receiver names
         - Updated AllTransfersAdminPage to include receiver_name in display and search
      
      This is a critical change - now when creating a transfer, the agent must enter:
      - اسم المرسل الثلاثي (sender_name)
      - اسم المستلم الثلاثي (receiver_name)
      
      When receiving, the system verifies that the entered name matches receiver_name.
      
      Ready for comprehensive testing of this critical feature.

      - All DELETE functionality verified and working correctly
      
      **Key Findings:**
      
      1. **DELETE Endpoint Functionality - FULLY WORKING:**
         - GET /api/commission-rates: ✅ Successfully retrieves all commission rates
         - DELETE /api/commission-rates/{rate_id}: ✅ Successfully deletes commission rates
